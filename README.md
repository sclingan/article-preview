## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned about using CSS animations, still need to work on a better understanding
of animation timing. I also learned about using a tooltip, using ::before and 
::after for the pointer.


### Continued development

I would like to return to this project and improve on animations and 
use a backend API to load different posts.
